# Install Jekyll

Assuming conda is installed, use the following commands to install Jekyll and the `github-pages` gem:

```bash
conda env create -f env.yml
conda activate gh-pages
```

Note that conda-forge may not have the most up-to-date version of the `github-pages` gem, but it should work fine.
